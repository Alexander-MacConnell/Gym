					Hi love, if you are reading this it means two things. First, the website decided to cooperate and I didn't throw my
				keyboard through my monitor, and second is, you have found your secret card! I just wanted to take a second to say I love 
				you more than anything, because I truly do. You mean the world to me and I hope you know that. I also wanted to say that 
				everything you've done lately is amazing and while so many people would struggle or give up on the idea of being healthy 
				and bettering themselves, you make it look easy and it rubs off on those around you, at least it does for me anyway haha. 
				So keep on going and if there's anyway I can help I'm always here for you. LOVE YOU! HAPPY VALENTINES DAY!
